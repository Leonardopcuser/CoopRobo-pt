For this, it is necessary that the UAVs communicate with each other and have a control strategy that determines what each one should do. This project includes three fixed-wing UAVs available at the Laboratory of Aerial Robotics at the University of Brasilia, which should be studied and implemented cooperative control techniques in the embedded hardware and software."
